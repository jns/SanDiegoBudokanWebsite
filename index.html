            <h1>About the San Diego Bud&#333;kan</h1>
            <p>
                San Diego Bud&#333;kan first opened its doors in 1968.  In the five decades since it's founding hundreds of 
                men and women have crossed the threshold of the d&#333;j&#333; and been transformed by the powerful teachings.  
                The traditions we study are not mere shells or archaic relics, but powerful living traditions that focus the 
                spirit and sharpen the mind.  Our goal as disciples of these traditions is to penetrate to the core of 
                conflict and strategy, and to emerge with the capability to act instantly and decisively with what is precisely 
                required by the situation.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We study two Japanese traditions: Itt&#333; Tenshin-ry&#363;<sup>&#174;</sup> Kenjutsu and Yamate-ry&#363;<sup>&#174;</sup> Aikijutsu. 
                These traditions require strict discipline and formality, and their study is a life-long endeavor.  Students are 
                expected to train a minimum of two times a week, are required to wear a training uniform, and will need to purchase
                the appropriate weapons and training tools. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We additionally offer a no-gi jujutsu class.  This is <u>not</u> Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  The no-gi jujutsu class 
                exposes students to small subset of very practical teachings from the Japanese traditions. Class focuses 
                on building conditioned responses to stressful and dangerous situations. Students dress in every day clothes
                and class will include drills to develop balance, sensitivity, and awareness. Students will practice 
                realistic scenarios and learn to act decisively, with intention and ferocity.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Our d&#333;j&#333; is closely affiliated with several other d&#333;j&#333; around the country. Additional 
                online resources including a blog, a listing of licensed d&#333;j&#333;, and online training can be found 
                at <a href="https://heiho.org">https://heiho.org</a>.

            <h1>Our Traditions</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>Itt&#333; Tenshin-ry&#363;<sup>&#174;</sup></h2>
                <div data-aos="fade-in"><img src="images/shodo-tneshin-ryu3-89x300.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"/></div> 
                <p>
                    Itt&#333; Tenshin-ry&#363; is a school of swordsmanship founded by Kurosawa Kojiro (circa 1900) and brought to the United States 
                    in the 1960s by the third-generation headmaster, Mr. Fredrick Lovret. The current headmaster is Mr. Arvind Rajguru. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the time the Itt&#333; Tenshin-ry&#363; was created, the major wars leading to the unification of Japan had 
                    been over for almost three hundred years. In keeping with the times, the techniques of the style are oriented more 
                    toward personal combat than mass engagements. The history of the Itt&#333; Tenshin-ry&#363; is not well documented 
                    prior to the founding of the tradition. According to our oral traditions, the heart 
                    of the art descends from the Itt&#333;-ryu through the Tenshin Itt&#333;-ry&#363;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the Itt&#333; Tenshin-ry&#363; is not to perpetuate a set of physical techniques or to preserve an archaic method of 
                    combat, but to develop a powerful and orderly being. Our methodology of training is short, simple techniques combined 
                    with vigorous training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The underpinning of this tradition is captured in the Four Essential Principles of the Itto Tenshin-ryu:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Techniques are to be done in a natural and fluid manner.</li>
                    <li>Techniques shall be large and open. Small techniques are for small spirits.</li>
                    <li>The development of a powerful and orderly being is of primary importance.</li>
                    <li>There is no defense; only attack, Attack, ATTACK!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Yamate-ry&#363;<sup>&#174;</sup></h2>
            <div data-aos="fade-in">
                <img src="images/shodo-yamate-ryu3-88x300(1).png" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"/></div>
            <p>
                The Yamate-ry&#363; began as a family martial art. It is a direct descendant of the Daito-ry&#363; and remains oriented 
                toward its original purpose; close quarters, multi-attacker, armed combat.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early years of the twentieth century, Takeda Sogaku, a master swordsman of the Ono-ha Itt&#333;-ry&#363;, was teaching his 
                family art, the Daito-ry&#363;, to certain influential people in northern Japan. Takeda never had a d&#333;j&#333;; he traveled from 
                place to place giving seminars. Some of these seminars were for individuals, others were to the hand-to-hand combat 
                instructors of police departments and military organizations, who later taught the art to members of their units.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yamada Taro was among Takeda's many students. After his Army days, Yamada continued his practice and taught his art, 
                now known as the Yamate-ry&#363;, to family and close business associates.  The style is closely related to modern Aikid&#333; 
                (Ueshiba was also a student of Takeda Sogaku), but has certain distinguishing characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fredrick J. Lovret introduced the Yamate-ry&#363; to the United States in 1968, when he founded the San Diego Bud&#333;kan.

                There are no contracts and we do not take credit cards.  Membership with our d&#333;j&#333; is a personal choice
                and a commitment to embark on a transformational journey.  That said, the d&#333;j&#333; does suggest a 
                noshi of $80/month to sustain itself.  If you continue the journey and become a senior member
                of the d&#333;j&#333;, the financial obligations to the ry&#363; will increase.
